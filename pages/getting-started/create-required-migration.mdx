# Create migration

For now you have created your enetity but it's still not defined in your database tables this is why we need to create a migration for it, Two options are available

- Automatically generate it.
- Write it manually (In this documentation we have choose this one).

[Look at Medusa documentation for more infos on Migrations](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/migrations/create).

[Look at Typeorm documentation for more infos on Migrations](https://typeorm.io/).

## Generate Migration File

```bash
npx typeorm migration:create src/migrations/BlogPostCreate
```

After running this command you'll have a simillar file:

`src/migrations/1696669623641-BlogPostCreate.ts`

```ts
//src/migrations/1696669623641-BlogPostCreate.ts

import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from "typeorm";

export class BlogPostCreate1696669623641 implements MigrationInterface {
  name = "BlogPostCreate1696669623641";

  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Complete...
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Complete...
  }
}
```

## Writing The Migration

```ts
//src/migrations/1696669623641-BlogPostCreate.ts

import { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from "typeorm";

export class BlogPostCreate1696669623641 implements MigrationInterface {
  name = "BlogPostCreate1696669623641";

  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`
        CREATE TABLE "blog_post" (
            "id" character varying NOT NULL,
            "created_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
            "updated_at" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
            
            "title" character varying NOT NULL,
            "slug" character varying NOT NULL,
            "content" character varying NOT NULL,

            CONSTRAINT "PK_1696669623641b6ad21b37ba1f" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
        )
    `);
  }

  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE "blog_post"`);
  }
}
```

## Running The Migration

1. Build your code

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Run migrations

```bash
npx medusa migrations run
```
